## Last.fm Recommender

This is a music recommendation web app that integrates with Last.fm to fetch user listening data. It uses tag-based content filtering and a k-Nearest Neighbors model to suggest similar tracks. Track tags are embedded into weighted vectors, scaled with StandardScaler, and compared using cosine distance. [Try Here](lastfmrecs.up.railway.app)
